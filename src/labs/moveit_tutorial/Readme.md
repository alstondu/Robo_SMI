# Lab 2 - MoveIt

This lab is an introduction to MoveIt in ROS. We will be using c++ for this lab and will start with a
recap of ROS services in c++. We will simulate our robot in RViz and a physics simulator called Gazebo.
We will finish by using a ROS package called MoveIt to move our robot and pick items.

Refering to [Lab_Instruction.pdf](https://github.com/alstondu/UCL-COMP0129-LAB/blob/main/src/labs/moveit_tutorial/Lab_Instruction.pdf) for detaled introduction of the tasks and instructions.
